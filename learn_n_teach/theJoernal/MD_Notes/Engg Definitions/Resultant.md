# Resultant
When a system of [[Force]]s acts on a body, it can be replaced by a single force
producing the same effect as that of the system of forces. It is called as [[Resultant]] of that [[System of forces]].

##### Resultant of a Coplanar Concurrent force system
R=√∑Fx <sup>2</sup>+∑Fy<sup>2</sup> and tan θ =∑Fy / ∑Fx
	
*Where, ∑Fx and ∑Fy is the algebraic sum of components of the forces along the horizontal and vertical direction respectively and θ is the angle made by the resultant with the horizontal axis.*

##### Resultant of Coplanar Non-concurrent force systems
R=√∑Fx<sup>2</sup> +∑Fy<sup>2</sup>
tan θ =∑Fy ∕ ∑Fx and  ∑M<sub>O</sub>

where M<sub>0</sub> is the algebraic sum of moments of all
the forces about a point O. The line of action of the resultant can be found from d, y as

d = | M<sub>O</sub> / R |,
x = | M<sub>O</sub> / ∑Fy | and
y = | M<sub>O</sub> / ∑Fx |, 
	
d=perpendicular distance of the resultant from O,
x = x intercept of **R**, y = y intercept of **R**.
##### Resultant of a Non-coplanar Concurrent force system
R=√∑Fx<sup>2</sup> +∑Fy<sup>2</sup> +∑Fz<sup>2</sup>

Where, ∑Fx, ∑Fy and ∑Fz are the algebraic sum of components of the forces along the X, Y and Z directions respectively. All the forces are represented as vectors. The basic vector algebra viz. position vector, unit vectors, direction cosines, dot product, cross product is studied.
##### Resultant of Non-coplanar Non-concurrent force system of forces
i) R=√∑Fx<sup>2</sup>+∑Fy<sup>2</sup>+∑Fz<sup>2</sup>
ii) ∑M0

where ∑M0 is the algebraic sum of moments of all the forces about a point O. The moment of a force is found by taking cross product between a position vector from the moment centre to any point on the line of action of the force and the force.
#####  Resultant using *Parallelogram Law of Forces*
R = √F<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +F<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub>Cosθ
