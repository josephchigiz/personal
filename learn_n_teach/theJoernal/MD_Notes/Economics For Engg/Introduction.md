# Basic Principles and Methodology of Economics
- [[Economics]] is the study of people and their choices. 
- It analyzes production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in a world of [[limited **resources** and unlimited wants and needs]]. 
- Economics also analyzes how rational people would react to a given [[scarcity]].
- It is derived from **Oikonomia** - a Greek word meaning household management.
- [[Adam Smith]] is the father of [[Economics]]. He was the first philosopher of his time to declare that *wealth* is earned through *productive labour* and that *self-interest* fuels people to puth their [[resources]] to best use.
- He argued that [[profits]] flowed from *capital investments* and [[capital]] was directed towards areas of highest [[profits]].

## Basic Economic Problems
1. *What to Produce*?
2. *How to Produce*?
3. *How much to Produce*?
4. *For whom to pruduce*?

## [[Scarcity]] and Choice
- [[Scarcity]] is one of the most basic concepts of [[Economics]].
- As the [[resources]] are always limited, [[choices]] have to be made.
- Every [[economy]] in the world faces a few basic economic problems.
- This is because there are always [[limited **resources** and unlimited wants and needs]].

## [[Factors of Production]]
- [[Economics]] is divided into four factors:
1. [[Land]] - Including all natural [[resources]].
2. [[Labour]] - Including all human [[resources]].
3. [[Capital]] - Including all man-made [[resources]].

## Resource allocation
- It is the process of assigning and managing *[[assets]]* in a manner that supports the organization's *strategic plans*.
